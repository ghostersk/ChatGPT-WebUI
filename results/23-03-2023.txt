No, there is no single Python code for creating a chatbot app. There are several Python libraries and frameworks that can be used to create a chatbot such as Rasa, Chatterbot, and NLTK. Each of these libraries and frameworks has its own set of features and functions that can be used to create a chatbot.
Here is an example of Python code for a ChatGPT app:

from chatgpt import ChatGPT

# Initialize the ChatGPT model 
chatbot = ChatGPT()

# Start the conversation
while True:
    human_text = input("You: ")
    bot_response = chatbot.get_response(human_text)
    print("Chatbot: ", bot_response)
